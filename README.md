# Mime

[Shared MIME-info database](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/) specification implementation in D programming language. Shared MIME-info database helps to determine media type of file by its name or contents.

## Features

### Implemented features

* Reading and using mime.cache files to match file names against glob patterns, match file contents against magic rules, resolve aliases and find mime type parents.
* Reading various shared MIME-info database files in mime/ subfolder, e.g. globs2, magic and others.
* treemagic support.
* Reading MIME types from mime/packages sources and mime/MEDIA folders.
* Determining MIME type by XMLnamespace if document is xml.

## Examples

### [Mime Database](examples/database.d)

Run to detect mime types of files.

    dub examples/database.d detect README.md source .gitignore lib/libmime.a /bin/sh /var/run/acpid.socket dub.json /dev/sda

Automated mime path detection works only on Freedesktop platforms. On other systmes or for testing purposes it's possible to use mimepath option to set alternate path to mime/ subfolder. E.g. on Windows with KDE installed it would be:

    dub examples/database.d --mimepath=C:\ProgramData\KDE\share\mime detect README.md source .gitignore lib/mime.lib C:/Windows/System32/notepad.exe dub.json

Run to print info about MIME types:

    dub examples/database.d info application/pdf application/x-executable image/png text/plain text/html text/xml

Run to resolve aliases:

    dub examples/database.d resolve application/wwf application/x-pdf application/pgp text/rtf text/xml

### [Mime Test](examples/test.d)

Run to test if this library is capable of parsing your local shared MIME-info database:

    dub examples/test.d

Run to see names of parsed files:

    dub examples/test.d --verbose

As with mimedatabase example you may specify paths to *mime* folder(s) via command line:

    dub examples/test.d --mimepath=C:\ProgramData\KDE\share\mime
